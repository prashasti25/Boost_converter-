# Boost_converter
In many technical applications, it is required to convert a set voltage DC source into a
variable-voltage DC output. A DC-DC switching converter converts voltage directly from DC to
DC and is simply known as a DC Converter. A DC converter is equivalent to an AC transformer
with a continuously variable turns ratio.
It can be used to step down or step up a DC voltage source, as a transformer.
The DC-DC Switching Boost Converter
is designed to provide an efficient method of taking a given DC voltage supply and boosting it to a
desired value.
